# Static Data Export

The [Static Data Export (SDE)](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources) is a CCP provided snapshot of static data used in EVE Online. A new version is typically released after every patch which changes the static data, though this may be delayed for various reasons.

It is provided as a ZIP archive containing many YAML files describing different aspects of EVE's static data, with some information encoded in the folder structure.
